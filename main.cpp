/*
 *  Filename:           main.cpp
 * 
 *  Purpose:            The purpose of this program is to read an input
 *                      text file, and write to an output text file. The
 *                      program will allow the user to view statistics of
 *                      an NFL player, as well as manually search for 
 *                      statistics of any player.
